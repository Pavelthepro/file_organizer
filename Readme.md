# Adobe Premiere Video Automation 


## Phase 1 

### To Do: 

In this phase we need to analyze a source directory and then place into a target directory (or series of target directories)


Logic 
*  Analyze all files with proper format. 
*  Look at the Created Modified date. 
*  Check if there is enough free space in target directories
*  Create folders in target directory 
*  Copy files into created folders 
*  Validate the files 
*  Add job to scheduler 



## Phase 2 

### To Do: 

*  Scan job queue for jobs. 
*  Open Premeiere 
*  Do premeiere stuff 
*  Add project to Adobe Encoder (Perhaps watch folder)


## Phase 3 

* Export and validate the file 


## Phase 4 

* Validate Exported File 
* Move file to Archive 



## Also we will need to update a situation when in the next iteration.
